CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnvcomp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "nvcomp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nvcomp" (requested
  version 3.0.3) with any of the following names:

    nvcompConfig.cmake
    nvcomp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nvcomp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nvcomp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "nvcomp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
